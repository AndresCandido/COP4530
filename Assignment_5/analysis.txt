Analysis of the worst-case time complexity for the makeEmpty function:

The makeEmpty function is responsible for deleting all nodes in the subtree pointed to by the given BinaryNode pointer.
It is a recursive function that traverses the tree in a depth-first manner to deallocate memory for each node.
In the worst-case scenario, the function needs to traverse all the nodes in the subtree to delete them.
The time complexity of the makeEmpty function depends on the number of nodes in the subtree.
Let's denote N as the number of nodes in the subtree.
In the worst case, each node needs to be visited and deleted.
Therefore, the time complexity of makeEmpty is O(N).
The function visits each node once and performs constant time operations to delete the node.
The recursion continues until all nodes in the subtree are visited and deleted.
Thus, the time complexity is directly proportional to the number of nodes in the subtree.
It's important to note that the time complexity may vary based on the structure of the tree.
If the tree is well-balanced, the number of nodes in each subtree will be roughly equal, resulting in a more balanced recursive process. However, in the worst-case scenario where the tree is highly unbalanced (e.g., skewed), the time complexity of makeEmpty would be O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the subtree.

To summarize:

Worst-case time complexity of makeEmpty: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the subtree.
