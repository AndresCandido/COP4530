Time complexity of clear() in Stack:
The time complexity of clear() in Stack depends on the underlying adaptee class used for storage.
Assuming the underlying adaptee class is a standard C++ STL container, such as std::vector or std::list, the time complexity of clear() is O(n),
where n is the number of elements in the container.

Explanation:
Clearing a STL container involves deallocating memory used by the container and resetting its internal state.
To achieve this, the container's clear() function typically traverses all the elements in the container and calls their destructors,
resulting in a linear time complexity proportional to the number of elements in the container.

In the case of Stack, the clear() function would call the clear() function of the underlying adaptee class,
which, in turn, would traverse the elements and deallocate memory accordingly. Therefore, the time complexity of clear() in Stack is O(n).

Please note that if a different adaptee class or custom container implementation is used, the time complexity of clear() could vary.
However, assuming the use of standard C++ STL containers, the analysis provided holds true.
